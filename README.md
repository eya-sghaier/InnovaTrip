# 🧭 InnovaTrip Ontology — README

## 🌍 Domain: Tourism

The chosen domain for this project is **tourism**, a vital field in economic, social, and cultural development worldwide. The **InnovaTrip Ontology** models key tourism-related concepts such as **tourists**, **guides**, **service providers**, **places**, **bookings**, **transportation**, and **media**, enabling semantic structuring and querying of information in tourism-related applications.

## 📑 Description of SPARQL Queries and Their Meaning

This section explains each SPARQL query used in the `InnovaTrip` ontology project, what it is designed to retrieve, and what kind of results it should produce.

---

#### 🟢 Simple SPARQL Queries

##### 1. Get all tourists' names
- **Query Purpose**: Retrieves all individuals of type `Tourist` and their names using the `foaf:name` property.
- **Results**: A list of tourists with their associated names.

##### 2. Get all bookings and their prices
- **Query Purpose**: Retrieves every `Booking` and its corresponding `price`.
- **Results**: A table with bookings and their associated price values.

##### 3. Get all reviews with their text
- **Query Purpose**: Fetches all `Review` instances and displays the written content (`reviewText`).
- **Results**: A list of reviews and the text written by tourists.

##### 4. Get all media and their URLs
- **Query Purpose**: Lists all media elements (images, videos, etc.) and their associated URLs.
- **Results**: A list of media entries with their respective media URLs.

##### 5. Get all transport services and their prices
- **Query Purpose**: Filters transport services like Bus, Train, Taxi, and CarRental and shows their prices.
- **Results**: A table with transport types and their prices.

##### 6. Get all bookings and their dates
- **Query Purpose**: Displays each booking and the corresponding date of the reservation.
- **Results**: A list of bookings along with their booking dates.

##### 7. Get all service providers with their ratings
- **Query Purpose**: Lists all individuals or entities that are `ServiceProvider`s with their given `rating`.
- **Results**: A table of service providers and how they are rated.

##### 8. Find tourists who are younger than 30
- **Query Purpose**: Filters tourists whose `age` is less than 30.
- **Results**: A list of younger tourists with their age displayed.

---

#### 🔷 More Complex SPARQL Queries

##### 9. Find service providers with a rating greater than 4
- **Query Purpose**: Selects highly-rated service providers by applying a filter on `rating`.
- **Results**: Providers with a rating higher than 4, sorted from highest to lowest.

##### 10. Get the name and nationality of tourists younger than 30 and from French nationality
- **Query Purpose**: Retrieves `foaf:name` and `nationality` for tourists who are French and under 30 years old.
- **Results**: A refined list showing French tourists below 30, with their names and nationality.

##### 11. List all photos with their resolution and the place they describe
- **Query Purpose**: Displays all `Photo` instances with their `imageResolution` and the `Place` they are linked to via `mediaOf`.
- **Results**: A list of photos, their resolutions, and the places they represent.

##### 12. List transport services with a bus or train route and their prices
- **Query Purpose**: Uses a UNION to gather transport services that either have a `busRoute` or `trainRoute`, showing their route and price.
- **Results**: Transport options filtered by type (bus or train), with their route and price listed.

## 🔧  SWRL Rules
SWRL rules enrich the ontology with implicit logic.

### ✅ 1. 🧓 Rule for SeniorGuide
If a Guide has more than 20 years of experience, classify them as a SeniorGuide.

**Explanation**: Adds experienced guides automatically to the SeniorGuide class.

Guide(?g) ^ experienceYears(?g, ?y) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?y, 20) → SeniorGuide(?g)


### ✅ 2. 🐶 Rule for PetLoverTourist
If a Tourist books accommodation that allows pets, they are considered a PetLoverTourist.

**Explanation**: Uses  object properties refersTo and bookingMadeBy, and data property isPetFriendly.

Booking(?b) ^ bookingMadeBy(?b, ?t) ^ refersTo(?b, ?a) ^ isPetFriendly(?a, true) → PetLoverTourist(?t)


### ✅ 3. 🈶 Rule for MultilingualProvider
If a ServiceProvider speaks more than one language, they are a MultilingualProvider.

**Explanation**: Uses languagesSpoken, assuming multiple entries indicate multilingualism.

ServiceProvider(?s) ^ languagesSpoken(?s, ?l1) ^ languagesSpoken(?s, ?l2) ^ swrlb:notEqual(?l1, ?l2) → MultilingualProvider(?s)


### ✅ 4. 😁 Rule for SatisfiedTourist
If a Tourist has reviewed an attraction or accommodation with a rating above 4.5, classify them as a SatisfiedTourist.

**Explanation**: Uses reviewedBy, rating, and inferred relationships.

Review(?r) ^ reviewedBy(?r, ?t) ^ rating(?r, ?score) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?score, 4.5) → SatisfiedTourist(?t)

...


## 🧾 Conclusion : Benefits of the Ontology
  The InnovaTrip Ontology provides a structured, semantically rich representation of the tourism domain. By modeling key entities like tourists, guides, service providers, bookings, and media, it enables:
  - Seamless integration and interoperability of heterogeneous tourism data
  - Intelligent querying using SPARQL and rule-based reasoning (SWRL).
  - Enhanced decision-making, search, and personalization features
  - A solid foundation for smart tourism systems such as recommendation engines, trip planners, and semantic web applications.

  This ontology transforms tourism data into machine-understandable knowledge, powering more insightful, flexible, and efficient digital tourism experiences. 🌐✨.
